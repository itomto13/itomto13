CLIENTS REVIEW/ RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
1.	Michelle Ann was a joy to work with as our virtual assistant. She took direction well and delivered tasks on time and to completion. She would implement and iterate based on clear feedback.
2.	Michelle was diligent and efficient in completing outreach tasks for me.
Her command of the English language and her organisational skills are examplary.

I would not hesitate in recommended her services.
3.	For someone who had never hired a virtual assistant based in the Philippines, it was a scary experience. Here was a person halfway across the world - 12 time zones apart! - who was going to access our marketing CRM, produce podcast episodes, create graphic design templates in Canva and manage the calendars for two key executives ... just to name a few responsibilities?

Michelle Ann made the experience easy and effortless. 

She created a playbook that had written as well as video training documentation for every single assignment we gave her.

She was available at all the exact hours she said she would be. In her time with MKG Marketing, Michelle Ann never missed a day of work without receiving approval for the absence.

And the biggest testament to her impact on our company: the documentation she created is still used to train OTHER people at the company to this day.

If you are looking for a motivated, intelligent and systems-oriented virtual assistant or off-shore talent to help with business operations, marketing, sales and other key business needs I would recommend messaging Michelle Ann *right now* before someone else hires her away from you.
4.	Michelle is an outstanding individual, punctual and committed to achieving all the tasks she's been assigned. She demonstrated remarkable leadership on our project. I highly recommend her.
